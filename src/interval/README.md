# Interval Algorithm Patterns
### Please support my repo with your star.

## Concept
The interval pattern deals with problems involving ranges, segments, or spans, where you often need to merge, compare, or cover intervals efficiently. These problems usually involve sorting intervals by start or end points and then iterating through them to check overlaps, gaps, or coverings.

## When to Use
- When handling problems about merging overlapping intervals.
- When determining if a set of intervals can cover a target range.
- When sorting or comparing ranges, events, or segments on a timeline.

## Common Operations
- Sorting intervals by start or end value.
- Iterating through intervals and comparing current vs. previous.
- Merging overlapping intervals or adding non-overlapping ones to a result.
