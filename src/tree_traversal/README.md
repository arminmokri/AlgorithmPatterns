# Tree Traversal Algorithm Patterns
### Please support my repo with your star.

## Concept
Tree traversal refers to visiting each node in a tree data structure systematically, often using depth-first (preorder, inorder, postorder) or breadth-first (level order) strategies. It’s essential for searching, updating, or analyzing hierarchical data and forms the backbone of many tree-based algorithms.

## When to Use
- When you need to visit all nodes in a specific order (e.g., left-to-right, top-to-bottom).
- When solving problems like subtree checks, depth/height calculations, or path finding.
- When transforming or reconstructing trees from traversal orders.

## Common Operations
- Recursively or iteratively visiting nodes in preorder, inorder, or postorder.
- Using a stack for DFS or a queue for BFS traversal.
- Tracking parent-child relationships, depths, or paths during traversal.
