# Binary Search Algorithm Patterns
### Please support my repo with your star.

## Concept
Binary Search is a divide-and-conquer algorithm used to efficiently find a target element in a sorted array or search space by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. It cuts the search time from linear O(n) to logarithmic O(log n), making it a fundamental technique in computer science.

## When to Use
- When the input array or search space is sorted.
- When you need to find boundaries (first/last occurrence, min/max) or check feasibility.
- When searching in monotonic functions or answer spaces (not just arrays).

## Common Operations
- Maintaining left and right pointers to narrow the search space.
- Calculating the mid index to compare with the target.
- Adjusting pointers based on comparison (left = mid + 1, right = mid - 1).
