# Backtracking Algorithm Patterns
### Please support my repo with your star.

## Concept
Backtracking is a recursive algorithmic technique for solving problems incrementally by trying partial solutions and abandoning them (‚Äúbacktracking‚Äù) if they fail to satisfy the problem‚Äôs constraints. It‚Äôs often used in constraint satisfaction problems like permutations, combinations, and puzzles.

## When to Use
- When the problem involves exploring all possible solutions (search space).
- When you can prune branches early using constraints to reduce unnecessary work.
- When problems require generating combinations, permutations, or subsets.

## Common Operations
- Recursively building solutions step by step.
- Using a ‚Äúpath‚Äù or ‚Äústate‚Äù that evolves with each recursive call.
- Backtracking (undoing the last step) when hitting dead ends or reaching base cases.
