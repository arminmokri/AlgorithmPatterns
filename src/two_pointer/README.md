# Two Pointer Algorithm Patterns
### Please support my repo with your star.

## Concept
The two-pointer technique uses two indices that move through a data structure (often an array or string) to perform searches, comparisons, or optimizations efficiently. The pointers can move toward each other, in the same direction, or at different speeds, allowing you to reduce time complexity from brute-force O(n²) to O(n) in many problems, especially when the data is sorted.

## When to Use
- When working with sorted arrays or lists to find pairs or triplets meeting a condition.
- When you need to reverse, merge, or partition elements efficiently.
- When scanning from both ends or managing a sliding range without extra space.

## Common Operations
- Initializing two pointers (e.g., `left` and `right`) at opposite ends or at the start.
- Moving one or both pointers based on condition checks (e.g., sum, match).
- Skipping duplicates, adjusting window sizes, or swapping elements.
