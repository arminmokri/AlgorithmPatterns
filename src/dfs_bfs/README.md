# DFS-BFS Algorithm Patterns
### Please support my repo with your star.

## Concept
DFS (Depth-First Search) and BFS (Breadth-First Search) are fundamental graph traversal algorithms used to explore nodes and edges in graphs or trees. DFS explores as far as possible down each branch before backtracking, while BFS explores all neighbors at the current depth before moving deeper. Both are essential for searching, connectivity checks, pathfinding, and cycle detection.

## When to Use
- When you need to explore or traverse all nodes in a graph or tree.
- When finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs (BFS).
- When solving problems involving connected components, cycles, or reachability.

## Common Operations
- Using a stack (explicit or recursion) for DFS.
- Using a queue for BFS.
- Marking nodes as visited to avoid cycles or repeated work.
