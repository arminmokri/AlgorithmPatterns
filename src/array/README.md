# Array Algorithm Patterns
### Please support my repo with your star.

## Concept
Array problems focus on using contiguous memory structures where elements can be accessed by index in constant time. Arrays are foundational for many algorithms, offering a balance of speed and simplicity, and are often used for sorting, searching, scanning, and sliding window operations.

## When to Use
- When you need quick, random access to elements by index.
- When working with fixed-size or contiguous collections of data.
- When optimizing space and performance without extra data structures.

## Common Operations
- Iterating through elements with loops or two pointers.
- Performing in-place modifications or creating prefix/suffix arrays.
- Using nested loops for pair/triplet combinations or subarray scans.
