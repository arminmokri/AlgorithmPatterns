# Matrix Algorithm Patterns
### Please support my repo with your star.

## Concept
Matrix problems involve navigating or modifying 2D grids or arrays, often under certain movement constraints (up, down, left, right, diagonal). These problems can incorporate elements of DFS/BFS, dynamic programming, backtracking, or simulation, depending on the challenge. They’re common in pathfinding, island detection, rotation, and flood fill tasks.

## When to Use
- When working with 2D data structures or grid-based maps.
- When movement across rows and columns must be tracked or restricted.
- When simulating transformations (e.g., rotation, traversal, spread).

## Common Operations
- Iterating through rows and columns using nested loops.
- Using direction vectors for movement (e.g., `[(0,1), (0,-1), (1,0), (-1,0)]`).
- Maintaining visited cells to avoid reprocessing.
